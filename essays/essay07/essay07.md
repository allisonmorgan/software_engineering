# Flask

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) is a "microframework" written in Pythgon for generating lightweight web applications. It calls itself a microframework because, at its core, it leaves all database interactions, form validation, authentication, etc. to other tools and libraries. Based on the [Web Server Gateway Interface Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface#Examples), Flask allows for simple interactions between web servers and applications, in this case Python scripts.

### Deeper Dive

Flask was developed in 2010, and is used by companies like [LinkedIn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXN3wuHUBP0#t=46) and [Pinterest](https://www.quora.com/What-challenges-has-Pinterest-encountered-with-Flask/answer/Steve-Cohen?srid=hXZd&share=1) for APIs. The creator of Flask, Armin Ronacher said:

> The idea of Flask is to build a good foundation for all applications. Everything else is up to you or your extensions.

Now, I will highlight the basics of Flask, which will hopefully elaborate upon the creator's mindset behind Flask.
