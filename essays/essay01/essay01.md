SQL (["Structured Query Language"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)) is a language for querying, manipulating, and inserting _relational_ databases. The language was introduced in the [1970s](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=362384.362685), and has been widely in use since then. SQL can be used on large data sets, to both aggregate features of several rows, and look at single rows in detail. And even though, SQL is almost 50 years old, [many relational database systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relational_database_management_systems) still in use today, handle interactions through SQL statements.

### Database Design

[Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) are those in which rows ("records") that contain common columns ("attributes") are stored within tables ("relations").
