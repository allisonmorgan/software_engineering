The [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers), "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer", was one of the first general purpose computers. Influenced by [World War II](https://web.archive.org/web/20180102192432/http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/96summary/index.html), its construction began in 1943 for the purpose of quickly and accurately calculating the trajectories of bombs and missiles, and continued to operate until 1956. ENIAC was designed by the physicist [John Mauchly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly), and electrical engineer [J. Presper Eckert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert) with the assistance of [seven other lead engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Development_and_design). In this essay, I want to first discuss the significance of this computer. Then, I will move on to highlight the six female programmers of the ENIAC.

### Importance of the ENIAC

The ENIAC was the [first electronic programmable computer built in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#The_electronic_programmable_computer). It was designed in a modular fashion, such that different panels performed different arithmetic functions. Results up to ten decimal places could be passed from different panels via wires and switches. Thus, at this time, "programs" were mechanically wired across the machine, and switches and plugs were manually reset upon each new computation.

The ENIAC was massive. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Components):

> By the end of its operation in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 2.4 m × 0.9 m × 30 m (8 × 3 × 100 feet) in size, occupied 167 m2 (1,800 ft2) and consumed [150 kW of electricity](https://books.google.com/books?id=-TKv7UHgoTQC&pg=PA74&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false).

[Computationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Operation_times), it could do 357 multiplication operations per second, and 35 division or square root operations per second. (Though not fast by our modern standards, this was obviously quite a speed up at the time over manual calculation!)

### ["Refrigerator Ladies"](http://mentalfloss.com/article/53160/meet-refrigerator-ladies-who-programmed-eniac)

The first programmers of the ENIAC - [Kay McNulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli), [Betty Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik), [Betty Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton), [Marlyn Meltzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlyn_Meltzer), [Fran Bilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Spence), and [Ruth Lichterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Teitelbaum) - were selected from a group of two hundred female "computers" from the School of Electrical Engineering at University of Pennsylvania. A "computer" was one who computed calculations - often with paper and pencil, and small calculator on hand. In this case, these women had been calculating ballistic trajectory tables.

As an aside, it was not unusual for human computers to be female at the time (e.g. [Harvard Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers) from much earlier, or [Dorothy Vaughn's work at NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan) contemporaneously). But roles that were typically male-dominated like "programmer" or "operator" were beginning to be filled by women due to the large fraction of the male population which was deployed in World War II.

As mentioned earlier, the profession of "programming" looked very different than it does today. These female programmers designed the circuits to handle the computation of artillery tables, and even in calculations of the [Hydrogen bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Role_in_the_hydrogen_bomb). Their work also inspired the [development of Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#History), central to simulations within the Manhattan Project and still very popular to this day. According to Wikipedia, the ENIAC was in constant operation for [nearly ten years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#The_electronic_programmable_computer), very much thanks to these six women.
