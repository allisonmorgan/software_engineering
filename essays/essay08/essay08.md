The [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Programmers), "Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer", was one of the first general purpose computers. Influenced by [World War II](https://web.archive.org/web/20180102192432/http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/comphist/96summary/index.html), its construction began in 1943 for the purpose of quickly and accurately calculating the trajectories of bombs and missiles, and continued to operate until 1956. ENIAC was designed by the physicist [John Mauchly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly), and electrical engineer [J. Presper Eckert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Presper_Eckert) with the assistance of [seven other male engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC#Development_and_design). In this essay, I want to first discuss the significance of this computer. Then, I will move on to highlight the six female programmers of the ENIAC.

The first programmers of the ENIAC - [Kay McNulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli), [Betty Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik), [Betty Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton), [Marlyn Meltzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlyn_Meltzer), [Fran Bilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Spence), and [Ruth Lichterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Teitelbaum) - were selected from a group of two hundred female "computers" from the School of Electrical Engineering at University of Pennsylvania. A "computer" was one who computed calculations - often with paper and pencil, and small calculator on hand. It was not unusual for human computers to be female at the time (e.g. [Harvard Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Computers) from much earlier, or [Dorothy Vaughn's work at NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan) contemporaneously). But roles that were typically male-dominated like "programmer" or "operator" were beginning to be filled by women due to the large fraction of the male population which was deployed in World War II.
