> 1. Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

Brooks divides the difficulties of development to software technology into two categories: those that are "essential", and those that are "accidental". Essential difficulties are inherent to software engineering. For example, ...

> 2. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

Unlike essential difficulties, accidental difficulties are not inherent, and arise spontaneously in the process of software development. Brooks argues that most developments to software engineering address these accidental difficulties. For example, ...

> 3. List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

The four properties of essential difficulties are: complexity, conformity, changeability, and invisibility.

- **Complexity:**
- **Conformity:**
- **Changeability:**
- **Invisibility:**

> 4. Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.

Here, a silver bullet refers to a single development in software engineering technology that results in 10 fold increase in efficiency, reliability, or simplicity. 

> 5. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

> 6. In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
